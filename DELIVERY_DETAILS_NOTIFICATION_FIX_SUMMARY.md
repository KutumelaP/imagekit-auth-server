# Delivery Details Notification Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Identified

When users choose delivery options (PAXI, Pargo, Store Pickup, or Merchant Delivery), **delivery details were only being sent in notifications for COD (Cash on Delivery) orders**. For other payment methods (card payments, etc.), the enhanced delivery information was being skipped until payment was confirmed, leaving sellers without crucial delivery details.

## Root Cause

The notification logic was conditionally sending enhanced delivery details only for COD orders:

```dart
// OLD CODE - Only COD orders got enhanced notifications
final isCOD = (_selectedPaymentMethod?.toLowerCase().contains('cash') ?? false);
if (isCOD) {
  // Enhanced notifications with delivery details
  final Map<String, dynamic> orderData = { /* delivery details */ };
  await NotificationService().sendNewOrderNotificationToSeller(
    // ... with orderData parameter
  );
} else {
  // ‚ùå NO enhanced notifications for card payments
  print('üîî Skipping notifications until payment confirmed by gateway (awaiting_payment).');
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Notification Logic for ALL Orders**
Modified the notification system to send enhanced delivery details for **ALL orders**, regardless of payment method:

```dart
// NEW CODE - ALL orders get enhanced notifications
// üîî ENHANCED NOTIFICATION LOGIC: Send delivery details for ALL orders
print('üîî Preparing enhanced notifications with delivery details...');

// Prepare order data for enhanced notifications (for ALL orders)
final Map<String, dynamic> orderData = {
  'deliveryType': _isDelivery ? 'delivery' : 'pickup',
  'deliveryAddress': _isDelivery ? {
    'address': _addressController.text.trim(),
    'suburb': '', // Will be extracted from address if needed
    'city': '', // Will be extracted from address if needed
  } : null,
};

// Add Paxi details if Paxi pickup is selected
if (!_isDelivery && _selectedPickupPoint?.isPaxiPoint == true) {
  orderData['deliveryType'] = 'paxi';
  orderData['paxiDetails'] = {
    'deliverySpeed': _selectedPaxiDeliverySpeed ?? 'standard',
    'pickupPoint': _selectedPickupPoint?.id ?? '',
  };
  orderData['paxiPickupPoint'] = {
    'name': _selectedPickupPoint?.name ?? 'PAXI Pickup Point',
    'address': _selectedPickupPoint?.address ?? 'Address not specified',
    'id': _selectedPickupPoint?.id ?? '',
  };
  orderData['paxiDeliverySpeed'] = _selectedPaxiDeliverySpeed ?? 'standard';
}
// Add Pargo details if Pargo pickup is selected
else if (!_isDelivery && _selectedPickupPoint?.isPargoPoint == true) {
  orderData['deliveryType'] = 'pargo';
  orderData['pargoPickupDetails'] = {
    'pickupPointName': _selectedPickupPoint?.name ?? 'Pargo Pickup Point',
    'pickupPointAddress': _selectedPickupPoint?.address ?? 'Address not specified',
    'pickupPointId': _selectedPickupPoint?.id ?? '',
  };
}

// Send enhanced seller notification for ALL orders (regardless of payment method)
await NotificationService().sendNewOrderNotificationToSeller(
  sellerId: sellerId,
  orderId: orderId,
  buyerName: buyerName,
  orderTotal: widget.totalPrice,
  sellerName: sellerName,
  orderData: orderData, // Pass enhanced order data
);

// Send buyer notification based on payment method
final isCOD = (_selectedPaymentMethod?.toLowerCase().contains('cash') ?? false);
if (isCOD) {
  print('üîî Sending immediate buyer notification for COD order...');
  await NotificationService().sendOrderStatusNotificationToBuyer(
    buyerId: currentUser!.uid,
    orderId: orderId,
    status: 'pending',
    sellerName: sellerName,
  );
} else {
  print('üîî Buyer notification will be sent when payment is confirmed by gateway.');
}
```
