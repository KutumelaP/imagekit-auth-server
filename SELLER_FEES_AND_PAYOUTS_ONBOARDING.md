## Fees & Payouts (for Sellers)

This page explains how fees work on the marketplace and how you get paid. Rates are VAT-inclusive and shown on invoices. Live values are pulled from admin settings and may change with notice.

### Commission per order
- Pickup: 6% (min R5, cap R30)
- You deliver: 9% (cap R40)
- We arrange courier: 11% (cap R50)

Volume tiers may reduce your rate automatically.

### Buyer-paid fees
- Service fee: 1% + R3 (min R3, max R15)
- Small-order fee: R7 for baskets under R100
- Delivery fee: pass-through to buyer

These buyer fees help cover payment processing and operations so your seller commission stays low.

### Cash on Delivery (COD)
- You collect the full order total from the customer.
- Platform commission is recorded as “commission due” and deducted from your next payout or payable via top-up.

### Payouts
- Standard: weekly payouts to your bank account.
- Instant payouts (optional): small additional fee if enabled.
- Minimum payout: R100.

### Example (R200 order, you deliver)
- Commission (9%): R18
- Buyer service fee (~R5) is charged to the buyer
- You receive: R182

### Changes to fees
If we update fees, we’ll notify you in-app and by email with the effective date. The live rates always show on your Seller → Earnings screen.
