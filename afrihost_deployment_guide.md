# ðŸš€ Afrihost Hosting Guide for Mzansi Marketplace

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy your Flutter food marketplace app to Afrihost's hosting platform. Your app is already optimized for web hosting with PWA capabilities.

## Prerequisites
- Afrihost hosting account (Shared Hosting, VPS, or Dedicated Server)
- Domain name pointed to Afrihost
- Flutter SDK installed locally
- Firebase project configured

## Step 1: Build Your Flutter Web App

### Option A: Build Locally
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /c/food_marketplace_app

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build for web with production optimizations
flutter build web --release --web-renderer html --dart-define=FLUTTER_WEB_USE_SKIA=false

# The built files will be in: build/web/
```

### Option B: Use the Existing Build Script
```bash
# Run the existing build script
./build_web_html.bat
# or
./build_web_html.ps1
```

## Step 2: Prepare Files for Upload

Your built web app will be in the `build/web/` directory. The key files are:
- `index.html` - Main entry point
- `main.dart.js` - Flutter app bundle
- `flutter_service_worker.js` - Service worker for PWA
- `manifest.json` - PWA manifest
- `icons/` - App icons
- `.htaccess` - Apache configuration

## Step 3: Upload to Afrihost

### Via cPanel File Manager
1. Log into your Afrihost cPanel
2. Open File Manager
3. Navigate to `public_html/` (or your domain's root directory)
4. Upload all contents from `build/web/` to this directory

### Via FTP/SFTP
1. Use FileZilla or similar FTP client
2. Connect to your Afrihost server
3. Upload all files from `build/web/` to `public_html/`

## Step 4: Configure Domain

### DNS Settings
Ensure your domain points to Afrihost:
- A Record: Point to Afrihost's IP
- CNAME: Point www to your domain
- Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

### SSL Certificate
- Afrihost provides free Let's Encrypt SSL certificates
- Enable SSL in cPanel â†’ SSL/TLS
- Your app will be accessible via HTTPS

## Step 5: Test Your Deployment

### Basic Functionality

- Test PWA installation on mobile devices
- Verify Firebase services are working
- Check service worker registration

### PWA Testing
- Use Chrome DevTools â†’ Application tab
- Test offline functionality
- Verify app installation prompts

## Step 6: Performance Optimization

### Enable Afrihost Features
- **Gzip Compression**: Already configured in `.htaccess`
- **Browser Caching**: Already configured in `.htaccess`
- **CDN**: Consider Afrihost's CDN for faster global delivery

### Monitor Performance

- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Check Firebase Performance Monitoring

## Troubleshooting

- Verify `.htaccess` is uploaded
- Check browser console for errors

#### 2. PWA Not Working
